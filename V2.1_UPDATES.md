- 💑 "You & Your Partner" branding
- ❤️ Heart-shaped like button
- 💝 Match celebration confetti animation

## 📊 How Current Features Work

### Daily Rotation Algorithm:
```javascript
// Movies change every day based on day of year
dayOfYear = current day number (1-365)
page = (dayOfYear % 10) + 1
// Shows different set of 20 movies each day!
```

### Recommendation Weights:
```javascript
Like a movie    → +1.0 to genre preference
Watch a movie   → +0.5 to genre preference
Pass a movie    → No change
```

### Match Expiration:
```javascript
Match created: Jan 30, 10:00 AM
Expires: Feb 1, 10:00 AM (48 hours later)
After expiry: Removed from matches list automatically
```

### Real-Time Notifications:
```javascript
App polls server every 3 seconds
Checks: "Any new matches since my last check?"
If yes: Show "It's a Match!" popup on BOTH devices
```

## 🔧 Streaming Accuracy Fix

**How it works now:**
1. Queries TMDB Watch Providers API
2. Checks US region specifically
3. Looks for "flatrate" providers (subscription streaming)
4. Matches provider name to Netflix/Prime/Disney+

**Improvements made:**
- ✅ Only shows badge if provider confirmed
- ✅ Checks exact provider names
- ✅ Doesn't show if data unavailable
- ✅ Regional specific (US only)

**Note:** TMDB data is updated weekly, so very new releases might not show streaming info immediately.
